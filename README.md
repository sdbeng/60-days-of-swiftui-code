# 60-days-of-swiftui-code

Welcome to Getting started with #60daysofswiftuicode 2021 project!! 

I'm glad you decided to join me on this challenge. I strongly believe that pair programming and collaboration between developers is not just the best idea to start and finish a project, but it gives you confidence and prepare you when you face roadblocks.

I know there are infinite number of tools and ways to go through this but I just want to get started right away - there will always be road blocks and life changes but I think I needed to set a few goals and work hard to make things happen. No more waiting. Let's beat procrastination!

My idea is to code a full iOS app with SwiftUI where I/we will be learning and testing up on the new Swift api. Of course, it will grow and improve over time.

2021 Goal: Publish and iPhone app to the App Store.

## Steps if you want to do the challenge:
